# Basic Vulnerability Checker
This console application uses the crudest functionality to test if your site may be open to attacks. 
The test targets the query segment of the URI. The method used in its utmost simplistic form is fuzzing.
Fuzzing is a method used to perturbs the input to the server and see if the server reacts to it.
If the server should, the console displays the type of vulnerability, and the site checked.

## How to use:
- Pull the master branch into Visual Studios (I am currently using .NET 5)
- Build the code
- Go to ** Solution Explorer ** and right-click -> (an options menu appears)
- Go down towards the bottom to **properties** and click the properties option -> (the main window displays the properties)
- On the right-hand panel find the Debug: click debug -> (the Debug options appear)
- The top large text box with the Lable Application arguments paste the URI you would like to test ->(text box contains uri)
- Close and run and wait for the results.

## currently only processes one uri at a time and only GET requests. Next efforts include
- PUT and POST request fuzzing.
- Dynamic fuzzing method
